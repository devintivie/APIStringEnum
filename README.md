# APIStringEnum
Creates framework for Enums with UI friendly descriptions with ability to have API string behind the scenes.

Goal is to be able to connect enumerable descriptions to API backend without use of several dictionaries.
Fully extendable and simple.

Not specifically designed for use as integer enum. See https://github.com/ardalis/SmartEnum for more integer-based enum style and or serial / deserialization.
Some logic based off https://github.com/ardalis/SmartEnum
